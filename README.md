# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

### Purpose

We were tasked to use different techniques to train and evaluate the models with unblalaced classes to predict credit card risk.  We were provided a CSV that contained data from lendingClub to use for the analysis.  We will use Python and imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling and use different supervised machine learning models for our analysis.

We used the 6 different algorithms for our analysis:

1.  Naive Random Oversampling
2.  SMOTE Oversampling
3.  Cluster Centroid Undersampling
4.  SMOTEENN Sampling
5.  Balanced Random Forest Classifying
6.  Easy Ensemble Classifying


 

## Results

1. Naive Random Oversampling:
